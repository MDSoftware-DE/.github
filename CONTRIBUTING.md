# Contributing Guidelines

## Language Policy

English is the default and required language for all contribution-related content:
- Repository documentation
- Issue titles and descriptions
- Pull request titles and descriptions
- Operational notes linked from issues/PRs

If a local-language artifact is unavoidable, add an English summary in the same change.

## Issue Hygiene

When opening issues:
- Use the provided issue forms.
- Keep the report concise and reproducible.
- Include concrete context, impact, and expected outcome.

## Pull Request Hygiene

When opening pull requests:
- Use the PR template.
- Link the related issue(s).
- Describe behavior impact and verification steps.
